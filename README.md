##### Note: the database platform, Supabase, would pause after a number of days of inactivity. This would cause the app to be unable to run and would require a manual reactivation on author’s side.

##### The url, http://aistudyplannerfyp.streamlit.app, works by connecting to my GitHub Repo on then Streamlit Development Site

##### The app can also run locally by running this in the terminal: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
